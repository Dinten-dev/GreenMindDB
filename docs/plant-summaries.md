# Plant Summaries

Documentation of sources and methodology for each plant's growing conditions.

## 🥬 Lettuce (Lactuca sativa)

### Sources Used
1. **Utah State University Extension** - General growing guide, temperature/humidity ranges
2. **Clemson University Cooperative Extension** - Cool-season crop requirements
3. **University of Kentucky Extension** - Soil pH requirements
4. **NCBI/PMC Research** - PPFD and DLI for controlled environment lettuce

### How Target Ranges Were Determined
- **Temperature**: Conservative range of 15-21°C based on agreement between USU (60-70°F) and Clemson (55-65°F)
- **Light PPFD**: Seedling 150-200, vegetative 250-400 μmol/m²/s from NIH/PMC hydroponic research
- **pH**: 6.0-6.5 from multiple extension sources (UKY, USU)
- **EC**: 1.2-1.8 mS/cm for hydroponic systems per research literature

### Notes
- Single vegetative stage used (no fruit production)
- Germination ranges narrower for temperature

## 🍅 Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)

### Sources Used
1. **Oregon State University Extension** - Commercial greenhouse guide
2. **Bayer Crop Science** - Temperature, humidity, VPD specifications
3. **Heliospectra** - DLI and PPFD by growth stage

### How Target Ranges Were Determined
- **Temperature**: 22-26°C daytime, 16-18°C nighttime per Bayer/OSU agreement
- **VPD**: 0.5-0.8 kPa increasing to 1.2 kPa generative per Bayer
- **Light PPFD**: Graduated from 200-300 (germination) to 500-800 (generative)
- **CO₂**: 800-1000 ppm for greenhouse; OSU cites 20%+ yield increase

### Notes
- Three stages: Germination, Vegetative, Generative
- Nighttime temperatures critical for fruit set

## 🥒 Cucumber (Cucumis sativus)

### Sources Used
1. **Oregon State University Extension** - European greenhouse cucumber production
2. **University of Alaska Fairbanks Extension** - Temperature requirements
3. **Heliospectra** - Light and photoperiod recommendations

### How Target Ranges Were Determined
- **Temperature**: 23-27°C vegetative, slightly cooler (20-24°C) generative per OSU
- **Humidity**: 60-75% - cucumbers tolerate high humidity well
- **Photoperiod**: 16-18h based on greenhouse research
- **PPFD**: 400-700 μmol/m²/s for production

### Notes
- Three stages used to reflect different requirements
- High light needs compared to lettuce

## 🌿 Basil (Ocimum basilicum)

### Sources Used
1. **Johnny's Selected Seeds** - Professional grower guide
2. **Eden Green Technology** - Hydroponic basil parameters
3. **Upstart Farmers** - Commercial production guidelines

### How Target Ranges Were Determined
- **Temperature**: 21-27°C consistent across all sources
- **Humidity**: 50-60% moderate range; high humidity risks disease
- **PPFD**: 300-500 μmol/m²/s; saturation at ~600 per research
- **pH**: 5.8-6.5 for hydroponics; slightly wider for soil

### Notes
- Two stages (no generative - harvest before flowering)
- High confidence on temperature ranges (sources agree)

## 🔴 Radish (Raphanus sativus)

### Sources Used
1. **Utah State University Extension** - Cool-season vegetable guide
2. **Texas A&M AgriLife Extension** - Commercial production
3. **Cornell University Home Gardening** - Soil and light requirements

### How Target Ranges Were Determined
- **Temperature**: 15-18°C optimal; bolts above 24°C
- **Light**: 8-12h photoperiod; full sun but tolerates partial shade
- **PPFD**: Lower than other crops (250-400 μmol/m²/s)
- **pH**: 6.0-7.0 from Cornell

### Notes
- Two stages only (fast-growing, no generative phase)
- Soil moisture important for root quality
- Some metrics at lower confidence due to limited controlled environment research

## Confidence Score Methodology

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.95 | Multiple university sources agree exactly |
| 0.90 | Sources agree with minor variation |
| 0.85 | Sources differ slightly; conservative range used |
| 0.80 | Limited sources; based on best available data |
| <0.80 | Single source or derived value |

All values without reliable sources were left empty rather than estimated.
